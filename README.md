# JavaEquiationSolver
_An equiation solver coded in java_

## Funcitionalities

The following features are readily available: Linear equiation solver for $ax+b=c$ type equiation. The coeficients could be integers and floats, currently the b could be non-negative. 

## Next steps

We plan to achieve in order of the planned actions:
1. handling all negative coeficients
2. extend to ax+b = c+d types
3. handling quadratic equiations
4. creating a user form reader
5. creating an OCR parser
